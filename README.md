## üìñ Overview
This project modifies the classic Kundur two-area power system by replacing a conventional generator with a solar PV farm. The system is simulated using **Typhoon HIL** to study grid stability, dynamic responses, and renewable energy integration challenges. The work includes detailed modeling of voltage source converters (VSCs), LCL filters, diesel generators, and transmission lines.

## üöÄ Key Features
- **Solar PV Integration**: 1.1 MW PV farm with grid-following control and LCL filter.
- **Advanced Control Systems**: 
  - VSC control with PLL synchronization, dq-frame current control, and tie-line bias strategies.
  - Frequency setpoint control and droop mechanisms for stability.
- **Real-Time Simulation**: Implemented in Typhoon HIL for dynamic analysis of power flow, voltage regulation, and oscillation damping.
- **Hybrid System Analysis**: Combines diesel generators (1 MVA) and solar PV under variable load/generation scenarios.
